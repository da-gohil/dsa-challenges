/* Searching from an array - we can do by multiple methods
I) Linear Search - Going thorugh all the elements and checking whether the element exists or not

EDGE CASES -> No element only exists in an array(length = 0) || array is pointing to null(array = null), 

2) take care of the edge cases before proceeding with the actual search, we don't check the rest of the elements once we'd found the element we were looking for

II) Binary Search - we repeatedly look at the middle element in the Array, and determine whether the element we're looking for must be to the left, or to the right
--> only works if the data is sorted
