## DSA Challenges

Welcome to the **DSA Challenges** repository! This repository is dedicated to my practise of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and solutions of Leetcode as well as solving the certification paths of HackerRank. I have created to also assist others like me to refer and improve their problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

### üìö 

- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays and Strings
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees and Graphs
  - Heaps and Priority Queues
  - Hash Tables
  - Tries

- **Algorithms:**
  - Sorting and Searching
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Backtracking
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
  - Bit Manipulation

### ü§ù Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have a new challenge, a better solution, or an improvement to existing code, feel free to open a pull request. Let's make this repository a valuable resource for DSA learners and enthusiasts around the world.
