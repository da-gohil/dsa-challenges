## DSA Challenges

Welcome to the **DSA Challenges** repository! This repository is dedicated to my practise of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and solutions of Leetcode as well as solving the certification paths of HackerRank. I have created to also assist others like me to refer and improve their problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

### üìö LeetCode

- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays and Strings
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees and Graphs
  - Heaps and Priority Queues
  - Hash Tables

  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Backtracking
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
  - Bit Manipulation

### üìö HackerRank
  - Java
  - SQL & Databases
  - Functional Programming
  - Regex
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Mathematics
